# SNOW-Asset-Management

- Build and maintain the logical service configurations of the infrastructure and application domains that support a service.

- They track the physical and logical state of IT service elements and associate incidents to the state of service elements, which helps in analyzing trends and reducing problems and incidents.

- The configurations are stored in a configuration management database (CMDB) which consists of entities, called Configuration Items (CI), that are part of your environment. 

## A CI may be: 
- A physical entity, such as a computer or router 
- A logical entity, such as an instance of a database 
- Conceptual, such as a Requisition Service 

## Why organizations need a CMDB
- IT organizations must control the process and realities of change that occur within the infrastructure. 

- A CMDB is a repository of configuration information which enables IT to meet these difficult challenges by centrally managing change across IT silos. 

- A CMDB also helps organizations implement and maintain ITIL processes as part of an overall IT Service Management strategy.

## There are multiple users of the CMDB within IT organizations:

- Change and Configuration managers use the CMDB to plan, manage and assess the risk of changes and configurations across the IT enterprise. 
- Service desk analysts can use a CMDB to diagnose the root cause of a service outage by providing insight into the Configuration Items (CI) that supports an affected service. 
- Problem management uses the CMDB to investigate and solve know errors.
- Architects and designers use the CMDB to help with infrastructure planning and development.

## Auto Discovery
Service-Now provides three options for auto-discovery:

- Our separate and highly robust Discovery product.

- Service-Now provides a lightweight native discovery tool, Help the Help Desk, as part of the overall CMDB.

- Service-Now can support integration to discovery  technologies via Web Services. Scanned data can be mapped directly into the CMDB. 

## Integration
The CMDB has relationships with IT service management processes in the following areas:

- ITIL Incident Management: Configuration Management assists Incident Management by: providing the Service Desk with immediate information on the CIs affected, and more timely resolution of faults by understanding what CIs have been affected and changed. 

- ITIL Problem Management: Configuration Management assists Problem Management by: linking the CIs affected by problems to the incident / problem / change management processes, and ensuring the CI status is properly maintained. 

- ITIL Change Management: Configuration Management assists Change Management by: recording which CIs have been changed and controlling the status of CIs throughout the entire CI lifecycle. Configuration Management ensures any changes made to CIs are recorded and kept accurate. 

## Creating Relation
To create a relationship between two CIs in the CMDB, three pieces of information are required:

The first half of the relationship.

The nature of the relationship

The second half of the relationship

When using the relationship editor, the first half of the relationship has already been selected for us based on the CI we started from when we launched the editor. The editor then concerns itself with collecting the next two pieces of information.
